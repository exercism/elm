## Bitwise operations

Bitwise operations allow us to manipulate individual digits within binary numbers.
These operations are fundamental in computing, providing an efficient way to perform low-level tasks, such as controlling specific bits in memory, optimizing mathematical calculations, encryption, communications, and encoding/decoding data.

### Understanding 32-bit Integers in Elm

In Elm, integers are stored as 32-bit signed integers using [two's complement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two%27s_complement) representation, meaning they use 32 binary digits (_bits_) to store each integer value.
This bit limit affects the range of integers that Elm can represent directly:

Positive Range: 0 to 2<sup>31</sup> - 1 (or 0 to 2,147,483,647)
Negative Range: -2<sup>31</sup> to -1 (or -2,147,483,648 to -1).

For example, the integer `5` is represented in binary as `00000000000000000000000000000101`, although usually we ignore the leading zeros and just say `101`.

### Bitwise

Elm provides several bitwise operators in its [Bitwise module](https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm/core/latest/Bitwise)

## Basic operations

Modifying individual bits of a number is called _masking_.
A _mask_ is a number where specific bits have been set in a particular way to manipulate another number using bitwise operators such as `and`, `or`, and `xor`.

### and

`and` combines two numbers by keeping only the bits that are `1` in both.
This is useful for checking to see if an individual bit is set.
For example, to check if the 4th bit of a number is set to `1`, `and` it with a mask of `01000` (`8` in decimal) and see if the result is non-zero:

```elm
Bitwise.and 13 8 --> 8
--  13 = 01101
--   8 = 01000
-- and = 01000 = 8
```

### or

`or` combines two numbers by setting each bit to `1` if it is `1` in either or both numbers.
This is useful for setting a specific bit to `1`.
For example, to set the 2nd bit in `10101`, `or` it with the mask `00010`:

```elm
Bitwise.or 21 2 --> 23
-- 21 = 10101
--  2 = 00010
-- or = 10111 = 23
```

### Exclusive-or (xor)

`xor` combines two numbers by setting each bit to `1` if it is `1` in one number but `0` in the other.
This is useful for flipping a bit to its opposite value:

```elm
Bitwise.xor 20 5 --> 17
--  20 = 10100
--   5 = 00101
-- xor = 10001 = 17
```

### Complement

`complement` inverts each bit of a number (`0` becomes `1`, `1` becomes `0`).

Note that this will result in positive numbers becoming negative, and negative numbers becoming positive.
This is because negative numbers in binary are represented with `1` in the left-most position.

```elm
Bitwise.complement 21 --> -22
--         21 = 00000000000000000000000000010101
-- complement = 11111111111111111111111111101010 = -22
```

### Bit shifting

The following operators move bits left or right by a specified number of positions, effectively multiplying or dividing by powers of 2.

`shiftLeftBy` moves bits to the left, filling in with `0` from the right-hand side.
For example, to shift `21` left by 3 places:

```elm
Bitwise.shiftLeftBy 3 21 --> 168
--  21 = 10101
-- shiftLeftBy 3 = 10101000 = 168
```

This is the same as saying `21 * 2^3 = 21 * 2 * 2 * 2 = 168`

`shiftRightBy`: Moves bits to the right:

```elm
Bitwise.shiftRightBy 2 21 --> 5
--  21 = 10101
-- shiftRightBy 2 = 00101 = 5
```

Shifting to the right by 2 places is the same as integer division by 4.

Note that this function duplicates whatever value is in the leftmost bit.
So, negative numbers will stay negative:

```elm
Bitwise.shiftRightBy 3 -21 --> -3
--  -21 = 111...101011
-- shiftRightBy 3 = 111...11101 = -3
```

If you want to shift right and fill in with zeros, use `shiftRightZfBy`:

```elm
Bitwise.shiftRightZfBy 3 -21 --> 536870909
--  -21 = 111...101011
-- shiftRightZfBy 3 = 00111...11101 = 536870909
```
