# If expression

```elm
isLeapYear : Int -> Bool
isLeapYear year =
  let
    divisibleBy number = 
      modBy number year == 0 
  in
    if divisibleBy 100 then
      divisibleBy 400

    else
      divisibleBy 4
```

An [`if` expression][if-expression] (`if … then … else …`) is a compound expression that uses a test to determine which of two alternatives to evaluate to.
Many other languages feature a similar construct, often termed 'ternary operator'.

## In this approach

This approach uses exactly two tests to determine whether a year is a leap year.

The first test is for divisibility by 100.
Once we know if the year is a multiple of 100, we know which further test to perform.

- If the year is evenly divisible by 100, then `divisibleBy 100` will evaluate to `True` and the entire `if` expression will evaluate to whatever `divisibleBy 400` evaluates to.
- If the year is _not_ evenly divisible by 100, then `divisibleBy 100` is `False` and so the `if` expression evaluates to `divisibleBy 4`.

This approach is not as concise as the [logical-expression][logical-expression], but it is [easier to describe][describable-code], which makes it easier to comunicate the problem domain.

## When to use `if`?

[`if` expressions][if-expression] might be a good fit when you

- need an expression that
- chooses between exactly two options
- depending on a single `Bool`.

When you have something other than a `Bool`, use `case` instead.
