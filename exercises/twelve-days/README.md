## Elm Installation

Refer to the [Installing Elm](https://exercism.io/tracks/elm/installation) page
for information about installing elm.

## Writing the Code

The first time you start an exercise, you'll need to ensure you have the
appropriate dependencies installed. Thankfully, Elm makes that easy for you and
will install dependencies when you try to run tests or build the code.

Execute the tests with:

```bash
$ elm-test
```

Automatically run tests again when you save changes:

```bash
$ elm-test --watch
```

As you work your way through the test suite, be sure to remove the `skip <|`
calls from each test until you get them all passing!
