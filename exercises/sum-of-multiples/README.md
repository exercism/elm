# Sum Of Multiples

Given a number, find the sum of all the multiples of particular numbers up to
but not including that number.

If we list all the natural numbers up to but not including 20 that are
multiples of either 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9, 10, 12, 15, and 18.

The sum of these multiples is 78.

Given a number, find the sum of the multiples of a given set of numbers,
up to but not including that number.

## Elm Installation

Refer to the [Exercism help page](http://exercism.io/languages/elm) for Elm
installation and learning resources.

## Writing the Code

The first time you start an exercise, you'll need to ensure you have the
appropriate dependencies installed.

```bash
$ npm install
```

Execute the tests with:

```bash
$ npm test
```

Automatically run tests again when you save changes:

```bash
$ npm run watch
```

As you work your way through the test suite, be sure to remove the `skip <|`
calls from each test until you get them all passing!
