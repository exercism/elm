# Design

## Goal

The goal of this exercise is to teach the students what are Booleans and what you can do with them.

## Learning objectives

- Know of the existence of the `Bool` type and its two values.
- Know about boolean operators and how to build logical expressions with them.
- Know of the boolean operator precedence rules.
- Know how to use conditional branching (if-then-else).

## Out of scope

- The actual definition of the `Bool` type as a sum type.
- Pattern matching.

## Concepts

The concepts this exercise unlock are:

- `booleans`: know of the existence of the `Bool` type and its two values; know about boolean operators and how to build logical expressions with them; know of the boolean operator precedence rules; know how to use conditional branching (if-then-else).

## Prerequisites

- `basics`: know the basic syntax of an Elm file.
