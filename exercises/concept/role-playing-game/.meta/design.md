# Design

## Goal

The goal of this exercise is to teach students about optional values enabled by the `Maybe` type and what you can do with it.

## Learning objectives

- Know of the existence of the `Maybe` type.
- Understand the type variable `a` of the `Maybe a` type.
- Know how to create a `Maybe` value.
- Know how to pattern match on its two values.
- Know how it relates to optional values and simple error handling.
- Know how to return a default value.

## Out of scope

- The generic concept of sum types.
- The generic concept of pattern matching, we simply focus on `Maybe`.
- The higher order `Maybe` functions such as `map`, `andThen`, etc.

## Concepts

The concepts this exercise unlock are:

- `maybe`: know of the existence of the `Maybe` type; understand the type variable `a` of the `Maybe a` type; know how to create a `Maybe` value; know how to pattern match on its two values; know how it relates to optional values and simple error handling.

## Prerequisites

- `basics-2`: Know the basic syntax of an Elm file.
