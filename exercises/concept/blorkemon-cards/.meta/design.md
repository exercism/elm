# Design

## Goal

The Goal is to learn comparisons.

## Learning objectives

- Understand what is the `comparable` type variable.
- Know about the main operators and functions for comparisons (`<`, `<=`, `>`, `>=`, `min` and `max`).
- Know about the `compare` function and `Order` type.
- Understand the ordering of tuples.
- Understand the ordering of lists.
- Know about `sort`, `sortBy` and `sortWith` for sorting lists.

## Out of scope

- The notion of constrained type classes

## Concepts

The concept this exercise unlocks is:

- `comparison`

## Prerequisites

- booleans
- tuples
- lists
- custom types
- records

## Analyzer

Make sure that:

- (essential) `sortByMonsterName` uses `List.sortBy`
- (essential) `sortByCoolness` uses `List.sortBy`
- (essential) `expectedWinner` uses `compareShinyPower`
- (essential) `expectedWinner` uses `case`
