# Design

## Goal

The Goal is to learn to use recursion

## Learning objectives

Students should be able to

- understand that it's a fundamental pattern in FP
- understand that many core functions are built with recursion
- use recursive functions
- write a recursive function

## Out of scope

Tail call recursion.

## Concepts

The concept this exercise unlocks is:

- `recursion`

## Prerequisites

- maybe
- lists
- pattern matching

## Analyzer

- [essential] functions from the `List` module are not used anywhere
