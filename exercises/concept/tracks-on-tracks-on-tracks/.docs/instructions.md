# Instructions

In this exercise you'll be writing code to keep track of a list of programming languages you want to learn on Exercism.
You have six tasks, which will all involve dealing with lists.

## 1. Create a new list

To keep track of the languages you want to learn, you'll need to create an new list.
Define the `newList` constant that contains a new, empty list.

```elm
newList
    --> []
```

## 2. Define an existing list

Currently, you have a piece of paper listing the languages you want to learn: Elm, Clojure and Haskell.
Define the `existingList` constant to represent this list.

```elm
existingList
    --> [ "Elm", "Clojure", "Haskell" ]
```

## 3. Add a new language to a list

As you explore Exercism and find more interesting languages, you want to add them to your list.
Implement the `addLanguage` function to add a new language to the beginning of your list.

```elm
addLanguage "TypeScript" [ "JavaScript", "CoffeeScript" ]
    --> [ "TypeScript", "JavaScript", "CoffeeScript" ]
```

## 4. Count the languages in the list

Counting the languages manually is inconvenient.
Implement the `countLanguages` function to count the number of languages on your list.

```elm
countLanguages [ "C#", "Racket", "Rust", "Ruby" ]
    --> 4
```

## 5. Reverse the list

At some point, you realize that your list is actually ordered backwards!
Implement the `reverseList` function to reverse your list.

```elm
reverseList [ "Prolog", "C", "Idris", "Assembly" ]
    --> [ "Assembly", "Idris", "C", "Prolog" ]
```

## 6. Check if list is exciting

While you love all languages, Elm has a special place in your heart.
As such, you're really excited about a list of languages if:

- The first item on the list is Elm.
- Or the second item on the list is Elm and the list contains three or less languages.

Implement the `excitingList` function to check if a list of languages is exciting:

```elm
excitingList [ "Nim"; "Elm" ]
    --> True
```
