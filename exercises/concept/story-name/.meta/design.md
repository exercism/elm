# Design

## Goal

The goal of this exercise is to understand pattern matching and destructuring in elm.

## Learning objectives

- Know how to pattern match on custom types.
- Know how to use wild cards `_` in pattern matching.
- Know how to use literals in pattern matching.
- Know how to pattern match recursively.
- Know how to use `as` in pattern matching.
- Know how to destructure in case expressions.
- Know how to destructure in function arguments.
- Know how to destructure in assignments.
- Know the naming limitations of destructuring records.

## Out of scope

- Nothing about pattern matching is out of scope.

## Concepts

The concepts this exercise unlock are:

- `pattern-matching`: Know ...; know ... .

## Prerequisites

- `custom-types`:
- `lists`:
- `maybe`:
