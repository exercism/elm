# Introduction

Pattern matching enables expressive branching code and destructuring brings elegant binding of values to variables.
Both are extremely useful to master as elm programmers to improve code readibility.

## Simple pattern matching

- Know how to pattern match on custom types.
- Know how to use wild cards `_` in pattern matching.

## Advanced pattern matching

- Know how to use literals in pattern matching.
- Know how to pattern match recursively.
- Know how to use `as` in pattern matching.

## Destructuring

- Know how to destructure in case expressions.
- Know how to destructure in function arguments.
- Know how to destructure in assignments.
