# Hints

## General

- String functions and operators are described in the [Elm documentation of the String module][string].

[string]: https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm/core/latest/String

## 1. Put Multiple Strings Together.

You can use a function or an operator from the `String` module to concatenate strings. Either one will get the job done.

## 2. Replace Strings

You can use functions from the `String` module to replace a string, or part of a string, with another.

## 3. Add Line-Breaks

The Unicode character for new-line is `\n`.

## 4. Recurse!

If you are having trouble making many similar verses followed by different ones, consider calling your own function again in such a way as to keep your original number of beers in scope.
