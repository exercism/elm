The goal of this exercise is to teach students about the `Dict` type and what you can do with it.

## Learning objectives

- Know about the Dict data structure.
- Know how to create an empty dict.
- Know how to get a value from a dict.
- Know how to add a value to a dict.
- Know how to remove a value from a dict.
- Know how to convert a dict to and from a list.
- Know how to iterate over a dict.

## Out of scope

- Nothing is really out of scope.

## Concepts

- `dict`

## Prerequisites

- `comparison`
- `maybe`
- `partial application`

## Ananlyser

- `filter` must be used in `removeInsignificantPlayers`
- `insert` must be used in `resetPlayerCounts`
- `sort` must not be used in `formatPlayers`
- `updateGoalCountForPlayer` and `List.foldl` must be used in `aggregateScorers`
- `Maybe.map` and `Maybe.withDefault` should be used in `formatPlayer`
- `merge` must be used in `combineGames`
