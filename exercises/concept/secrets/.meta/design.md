# Design

## Goal

The Goal is to learn to use the `Bitwise` module

## Learning objectives

Students should be able to

- understand the basics of binary encoding for integers
- know that Elm integers are 32 bits and the implications of that
- use basic operations (and, or, xor, complement)
- use bit shifts operations (`shiftLeftBy`, `shiftRightBy`, `shiftRightZfBy`)

## Out of scope

Nothing

## Concepts

The concept this exercise unlocks is:

- `bitwise-operations`

## Prerequisites

- basics-1
- basics-2

## Analyzer

- `decrypt` should use all the previously defined functions: `shiftBack` `setBits` `flipBits` `clearBits`
