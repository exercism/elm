## 4. Create a team

## 5. Replace the coach

- There is [special syntax][update] to return a copy of a record but with one or more fields having a new value.

## 6. Check for same team

- Elm uses structural equality, which means that records that have the same values are equal.

## 7. Check if you should root for a team

- The best way to execute logic based on the team's value is to use [pattern matching][pattern-matching].
