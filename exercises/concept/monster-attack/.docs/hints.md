# General

- [Partial application][partial-application] and [`(|>)`][pipe-operator] make it easy to write elegant, chained, code, when the main data structure as last argument of functions. All the common functions in the standard library do this, such as `List.map`
- A [Let statement][let] can be used in the `attack` functions to partially apply the `attackWithSword` and `attachWithClaw` functions with the correct strength for Annalyn and Kazak.
