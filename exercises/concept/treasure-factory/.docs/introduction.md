# Introduction

Elm types allow generic types, that generally add flexibility to an interface.
For example, the type `Maybe a` can hold a value of any type.

```elm
type Maybe a = Nothing | Just a
```

Note that on the example above, the type parameter `a` is used on both sides of the equal sign `=`.
We say that `a` is bound to some data inside the type definition.

## The phantom type technique

In certain cases however, the type parameter only appears on the left side of the equation.

```elm
type Distance unit = Distance Float
```

In the definition of `Distance` above, `unit` is a free type parameter, not bound to any data in the type.
We can also call this type a **phantom type**.

It is surprisingly useful when we want to enforce constraints at compile time.
For example, we want to make sure that we only add distances of the same unit.

```elm
-- Distance is an opaque type, since the module does not expose its variants.
-- This means that users may only use the functions meter, foot and add to manipulate distances.
module Distance exposing (Distance, Meter, Foot, meter, foot, add)

-- The Distance type has a phantom type 'unit'.
type Distance unit = Distance Float

-- We define two types that will be used in place
-- of the phantom type 'unit' in our constructor functions.
type Meter = Meter
type Foot = Foot

-- Constructor for Meter
meter : Distance Meter
meter = Distance 1.0

-- Constructor for Foot
foot : Distance Foot
foot = Distance 0.3048

-- The add function cannot take two parameters of different types.
-- So we cannot add meters and feet by mistake.
add : Distance unit -> Distance unit -> Distance unit
add (Distance d1) (Distance d2) = Distance (d1 + d2)
```

Code outside of that module cannot access the internal of the `Distance` type.
Users can add two `Distance Meter` but cannot add a `Distance Meter` with a `Distance Foot`.

```elm
import Distance exposing (Distance)

-- Compiles
twoMeters = Distance.add Distance.meter Distance.meter

-- Does not compile
errDist = Distance.add Distance.meter Distance.foot
```

## Extensible records as phantom types

There is no restriction on which types can be phantom, and record types can be used as well.
When used as phantom types, records are able to express complex constraints that can transform through functions.

Let's add a new distance unit inside of the `Distance` module called `LegoBlock`.
Physical blocks, being regulated objects, always have two properties: they have non-fractional and non-negative distances.

```elm
type LegoBlock = LegoBlock

fourStuds : Distance { properties | unit: LegoBlock, nonFractional : (), nonNegative: () }
fourStuds = Distance 4.0
```

`nonFractional` and `nonNegative` are the fields of a record that doesn't exist outside of a type argument, so it's fitting to give them the type `()`, called the __unit type__, which holds no information beyond the fact that it is there.

Obtaining arbitrary `LegoBlock` distances is of course possible, for example after computing distance differences or ratios.

```elm
negativeStud : Distance { properties | unit: LegoBlock, nonFractional : () }
negativeStud = Distance -1.0

threeFiddyStud : Distance { properties | unit: LegoBlock, nonNegative : () }
threeFiddyStud = Distance 3.50

crazyStud : Distance { properties | unit: LegoBlock }
crazyStud = Distance -13.37
```

All the above values are valid and will compile, however we have a special interest in values like `fourStuds` that have both the `nonFractional` and `nonNegative` properties because they represent physical blocks that can be combined with

```elm
combineLegoBlocks
  :  Distance { properties | unit: LegoBlock, nonFractional : (), nonNegative: () }
  -> Distance { properties | unit: LegoBlock, nonFractional : (), nonNegative: () }
  -> Distance { properties | unit: LegoBlock, nonFractional : (), nonNegative: () }
combineLegoBlocks = add
```

Let's add some functions to let users create and refine `LegoBlock` distances.

```elm
newLegoBlock : Float -> Distance { properties | unit: LegoBlock }
newLegoBlock dist = Distance dist

floorDistance : Distance properties -> Distance { properties | nonFractional : () }
floorDistance (Distance dist) = Distance (toFloat (floor dist))

ceilingDistance : Distance properties -> Distance { properties | nonFractional : () }
ceilingDistance (Distance dist) = Distance (toFloat (ceiling dist))

absDistance : Distance properties -> Distance { properties | nonNegative : () }
absDistance (Distance dist) = Distance (abs dist)
```

Note that `floorDistance`, `ceilingDistance` and `absDistance` can handle unit other than `LegoBlock`, and in general do not make any assumptions on the input properties, they merely guarantee that the output will have a specific property, either `nonFractional` or `nonNegative`.

Let's look at some outcomes.

```elm
import Distance exposing (Distance)

-- Compiles
distance1 = combineLegoBlocks fourStuds fourStuds

-- Does not compile
distance2 = combineLegoBlocks fourStuds threeFiddyStud

-- Compiles
distance3 = combineLegoBlocks fourStuds (floorDistance threeFiddyStud)

-- Does not compile
distance4 = combineLegoBlocks fourStuds negativeStud

-- Compiles
distance5 = combineLegoBlocks fourStuds (absDistance negativeStud)

-- Does not compile
distance6 = combineLegoBlocks fourStuds crazyStud

-- Compiles
distance7 = combineLegoBlocks fourStuds (floorDistance (absDistance crazyStud))

-- Compiles
distance8 = combineLegoBlocks fourStuds (ceilingDistance (absDistance crazyStud))
```

In general, `floorDistance` and `ceilingDistance` provide different results, but the same guarantees.
This is the strength of the phantom type technique: providing flexible choices to users while maintaining strong guarantees.
