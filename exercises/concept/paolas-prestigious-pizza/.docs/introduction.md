# Introduction

## Parsing

Parsing is the process of transforming text into meaningful data.
Functions from the `String` package are limiting in that regard and regular expressions are difficult to use, so the idiomatic way in Elm to parse is with the `elm/parser` package.

Let's walk through an example of writing a parser for (a subset of) the programming language [LOLCODE][lolcode].
Let's consider the following commented program:

```
HAI 1                 # program version 1
CAN HAS STDIO?        # import stdio
VISIBLE "HAI WORLD!"  # print "HAI WORLD!"
KTHXBYE               # end of program
```

First, let's write an Elm type to represent the possible commands:

```elm
type Command
    = Version Int
    | Import String
    | Print String
```

Our LOLCODE program can then be modeled as a `List Command`.
Let's start with a parser for the `HAI 1` line:

```elm
versionP : Parser Command
versionP =
    Parser.succeed Version
        |. Parser.keyword "HAI"
        |. Parser.spaces
        |= Parser.int
```

`versionP` is built using a _parser pipeline_.
The `(|.)` operator means "parse the string but throw away the result" and `(|=)` means "parse the string and keep the result".
In this example, `Parser.keyword "HAI"` will consume a "HAI", but that result is ignored. 
`Parser.spaces` will consume any number of  ' ', '\n', and '\r' characters, but that will also be ignored.
`Parser.int` will parse an integer, and the value of that integer (say 1) will be passed to the topmost `Parser.succeed Version` and the parser will succeed in returning the value `Version 1`.

If any one of the parser in the pipeline fails, it will return a `Parser.DeadEnd` and the whole parser will fail.
A parser can be ran with `Parser.run`:

```elm
Parser.run versionP "HAI 1"
    --> Ok (Version 1)
Parser.run versionP "HAI 2"
    --> Ok (Version 2)
Parser.run versionP "BYE 2"
    --> Err [{ problem = ExpectingKeyword "HAI", col = 1, row = 1 }]
Parser.run versionP "HAI MOM"
    --> Err [{ problem = ExpectingInt, col = 5, row = 1 }]
```

Let's attack the "CAN HAS STDIO?" line with

```elm
importP : Parser Command
importP =
    Parser.succeed Import
        |. Parser.keyword "CAN HAS"
        |. Parser.spaces
        |= packageP
        |. Parser.symbol "?"
```

`importP` is also a parser pipeline, but this time ends with `Parser.symbol` that is suitable for parsing symbols such as "?".
The value that we want to keep (the name of the package to import) is parsed by

```elm
packageP : Parser String
packageP =
    Parser.chompWhile Char.isAlphaNum
        |> Parser.getChompedString
        |> Parser.map String.toLower
```

Since we don't know what the package name will be, we cannot use `Parser.keyword`, so instead we use `Parser.chompWhile` that will consume single characters as long as they satisfy a condition (here, being an alphanumeric character).
These chomped characters are then collected by `Parser.getChompedString` that returns a `Parser String`.
In this case, we would like to normalize the package names, so we use `Parser.map` to modify the string contained in the parser and make it lowercase.

```elm
Parser.run importP "CAN HAS STDIO?"
    --> Ok (Import "stdio") 
Parser.run importP "CAN HAS StDiO?"
    --> Ok (Import "stdio") 
Parser.run importP "CAN HAS STDIO"
    -->  Err [{ problem = ExpectingSymbol "?", col = 14, row = 1 }]
```

Next up, `VISIBLE "HAI WORLD!"` is parsed by

```elm
printP : Parser Command
printP =
    Parser.succeed Print
        |. Parser.keyword "VISIBLE"
        |. Parser.spaces
        |. Parser.symbol "\""
        |= stringP
        |. Parser.symbol "\""

stringP : Parser String
stringP =
    Parser.chompWhile (\c -> c /= '"')
        |> Parser.getChompedString

Parser.run printP "VISIBLE \"HAI WORLD!\""
    --> Ok (Print "HAI WORLD!")
```

We now have a parser for each command.
Of course, in a general program, the order of these commands cannot be predicted, so we build a generic command parser

```elm
commandP : Parser Command
commandP =
    Parser.oneOf
        [ versionP
        , importP
        , printP
        ]
```

`Parser.oneOf` will try one parser, in the given order.
If a parser fails, the next one is tried, but if it succeeds, its result is returned without trying the remaining parsers.
If all parsers fail, `Parser.oneOf` fails.

```elm
Parser.run commandP "HAI 2"
    --> Ok (Version 2)
Parser.run commandP "CAN HAS STDIO?"
    --> Ok (Import "stdio") 
Parser.run commandP "VISIBLE \"HAI WORLD!\""
    --> Ok (Print "HAI WORLD!")
Parser.run commandP "O NOES"
    --> Err [ { problem = ExpectingKeyword "HAI", col = 1, row = 1 }
    --      , { problem = ExpectingKeyword "CAN HAS", col = 1, row = 1 }
    --      , { problem = ExpectingKeyword "VISIBLE", col = 1, row = 1 }
    --      ]
```

Note how each failed attempt produces a `Parser.DeadEnd` that is collected by `Parser.oneOf`.

To parse a full program, we need to parse several commands sequentially with

```elm
programP : Parser (List Command)
programP =
    Parser.sequence
        { start = ""
        , separator = "\n"
        , end = "KTHXBYE"
        , spaces = Parser.succeed ()
        , item = commandP
        , trailing = Parser.Optional
        }
```

`Parser.sequence` is a very customizable parser with a number of options.
`start`, `separator` and `end` take strings that separate the items of the sequence, for parsing an Elm list we would use "[", "," and "]".
`spaces` provides flexibility by taking a parser that will handle potential spaces between items and separators, for parsing an Elm list we would use `Parser.spaces`, but in this case we don't accept any spaces so we use `Parser.succeed ()` that succeeds immediately without actually consuming anything.
`item` takes the item parser, and finally, `trailing` lets us decide if trailing separators are `Parser.Forbidden`, `Parser.Mandatory` or `Parser.Optional`.

```elm
Parser.run programP "HAI 2\nCAN HAS STDIO?\nKTHXBYE"
    --> Ok [Version 2, Import "stdio"]
Parser.run programP "KTHXBYE"
    --> Ok []
Parser.run programP "HAI 2\nCAN HAS STDIO?\n"
    --> Err [ { problem = ExpectingKeyword "HAI", col = 1, row = 3 }
    --      , { problem = ExpectingKeyword "CAN HAS", col = 1, row = 3 }
    --      , { problem = ExpectingKeyword "VISIBLE", col = 1, row = 3 }
    --      , { problem = Expecting "KTHXBYE", col = 1, row = 3 }
    --      ]
```

When parsers succeed, they stop consuming the string

```elm
Parser.run Parser.int "1"
    --> Ok 1
Parser.run Parser.int "1 BTW VISIBLE \"U SEE NOTHING\""
    --> Ok 1
```

So if we need to make sure we parsed everything in the string, we may use `Parser.end`

```elm
fullProgramP : Parser (List Command)
fullProgramP =
    programP
        |. Parser.spaces
        |. Parser.end

Parser.run fullProgramP "HAI 2\nCAN HAS STDIO?\nKTHXBYE"
    --> Ok [Version 2, Import "stdio"]
Parser.run fullProgramP "HAI 2\nCAN HAS STDIO?\nKTHXBYE\nBTW VISIBLE \"U SEE NOTHING\""
    --> Err [{ problem = ExpectingEnd, col = 1, row = 4 }]    
```

Finally, we sometimes need to make a decision to fail a parser depending on its parsed content.
For example, if we needed a  parser that failed programs that start with two "HAI" commands in a row, we could use

```elm
singleVersionProgramP : Parser (List Command)
singleVersionProgramP =
    fullProgramP
        |> Parser.andThen
            (\commands ->
                case commands of
                    (Version _) :: (Version _) :: _ ->
                        Parser.problem "Multiple versions defined"

                    _ ->
                        Parser.succeed commands
            )
```

`Parser.andThen` can inspect the content of a parser and returns a new parser depending on its value.
Here, we failed the parser with a custom message using `Parser.problem` in one case, and returned the original value in the other.

```elm
Parser.run singleVersionProgramP "HAI 2\nCAN HAS STDIO?\nKTHXBYE"
    --> Ok [Version 2, Import "stdio"]
Parser.run singleVersionProgramP "HAI 1\nHAI 2\nCAN HAS STDIO?\nKTHXBYE"
    --> Err [{ problem = Problem "Multiple versions defined", col = 8, row = 4 }]
```
