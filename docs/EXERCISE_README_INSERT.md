## Elm Installation

Refer to the [Exercism help page](http://exercism.io/languages/elm) for Elm
installation and learning resources.

## Writing the Code

The first time you start an exercise, you'll need to ensure you have the
appropriate dependencies installed.

```bash
$ npm install
```

Execute the tests with:

```bash
$ npm test
```

As you work your way through the test suite, be sure to remove the `skip <|`
calls from each test until you get them all passing!
