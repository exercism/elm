## Installing on any platform

The simplest way to install Elm is via Node.js/NPM.

If you don't already have Node.js installed on your computer, you can download 
it from [the official site](https://nodejs.org/). Once you have Node.js up and
running, you can install elm and elm-test using 

```bash
npm install -g elm elm-test@beta
```

which will install Elm and place any tooling on `$PATH`.
