## Installing on any platform

The simplest way to install Elm is via Node.js/NPM.

If you don't already have Node.js installed on your computer, you can download it from [the official site](https://nodejs.org/). Once you have Node.js up and running, follow these steps to install the Elm platform and elm-test.

```bash
$ npm install --global elm elm-test
```
